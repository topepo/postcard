\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class "formula" (or one that can be coerced to that class):
a symbolic description used in \code{\link[stats:model.frame]{stats::model.frame()}} to create a \code{data.frame} with
response and covariates. This data.frame is used to estimate the \eqn{R^2}, which is
then used to find the variance. See more in details.}

\item{data}{a data frame, list or environment (or object
    coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}} to a data frame),
    containing the variables in \code{formula}.  Neither a matrix nor an
    array will be accepted.}

\item{inflation}{a \code{numeric} to multiply the marginal variance of the response by.
Default is \code{1} which estimates the variance directly from data. Use values above \code{1}
to obtain a more conservative estimate of the marginal response variance.}

\item{deflation}{a \code{numeric} to multiply the \eqn{R^2} by.
Default is \code{1} which means the estimate of \eqn{R^2} is unchanged. Use values
below \code{1} to obtain a more conservative estimate of the coefficient of determination.
See details about how \eqn{R^2} related to the estimation.}

\item{variance}{a \code{numeric} variance to use for the approximation. See more details
in documentation sections of each power approximating function.}

\item{ate}{a \code{numeric} minimum effect size that we should be able to detect.}

\item{n}{a \code{numeric} with number of participants in total.
From this number of participants in the treatment group is \eqn{n1=(r/(1+r))n}
and the control group is \eqn{n1=(1/(1+r))n}.}

\item{r}{a \code{numeric} allocation ratio \eqn{r=n1/n0}. For one-to-one randomisation \code{r=1}.}

\item{margin}{a \code{numeric} superiority margin (for non-inferiority margin, a negative value can be provided).}

\item{alpha}{a \code{numeric} significance level. Due to regulatory guidelines when
using a one-sided test, half the specified significance level is used.
Thus, for standard significance level of 5\%, the default is \code{alpha = 0.025}.}

\item{power}{a \code{numeric} giving the desired power when calculating the sample size}

\item{df}{a \code{numeric} degrees of freedom to use in the t-distribution.}
}
\value{
All functions return a \code{numeric}. \code{variance_ancova} returns a \code{numeric} with
a variance estimated from data to used for power estimation and sample size
estimation. \code{power_xx} and \code{samplesize_xx} functions return a \code{numeric} with
the power or sample size approximation.
}
\description{
\code{variance_ancova} provides a convenient function for estimating a
variance to use for power and sample size approximation.

The \code{power_gs} and \code{samplesize_gs} functions calculate the Guenther-Schouten
power approximation for ANOVA or ANCOVA.
The approximation is based in (Guenther WC. Sample Size Formulas for Normal Theory T Tests.
The American Statistician. 1981;35(4):243–244) and (Schouten HJA. Sample size formula with
a continuous outcome for unequal group sizes and unequal variances. Statistics in Medicine.
1999;18(1):87–91).

The function \code{power_nc} calculates the power for ANOVA or ANCOVA based on the
non-centrality parameter and the exact t-distributions.

See more details about each funtion in \code{Details} and in sections after \code{Value}.

\details{
This details section provides information about relation between arguments to
functions and the formulas described in sections below for each power
approximation formula.

Note that all entities that carry the same name as an argument and in the formula
will not be mentioned below, as they are obviously linked (n, r, alpha)
\itemize{
\item \code{ate}: \eqn{\beta_1-\beta_0}
\item \code{margin}: \eqn{\Delta_s}
\item \code{variance}: \eqn{\widehat{\sigma}^2(1-\widehat{R}^2)}
}
\subsection{Finding the \code{variance} to use for approximation}{

The \code{variance_ancova} function estimates \eqn{\sigma^2(1-R^2)} in data and
returns it as a \code{numeric} that can be passed directly as the \code{variance}
in \code{power_gs}. Corresponds to estimating the power from using an \code{lm} with
the same \code{formula} as specified in \code{variance_ancova}.

The user can estimate the \code{variance} any way they see fit.

\section{Guenther-Schouten power approximation}{

The estimation formula in the case of an ANCOVA model with multiple covariate adjustement is (see description for reference):

\deqn{
n=\frac{(1+r)^2}{r}\frac{(z_{1-\alpha}+z_{1-\beta})^2\widehat{\sigma}^2(1-\widehat{R}^2)}{(\beta_1-\beta_0-\Delta_s)^2}+\frac{(z_{1-\alpha})^2}{2}
}

where \eqn{\widehat{R}^2\coloneqq \frac{\widehat{\sigma}_{XY}^\top \widehat{\Sigma}_X^{-1}\widehat{\sigma}_{XY}}{\widehat{\sigma}^2}},
we denote by \eqn{\widehat{\sigma^2}} an estimate of the variance of the outcome,
\eqn{\widehat{\Sigma_X}} and estimate of the covariance matrix of the
covariates, and \eqn{\widehat{\sigma_{XY}}} a \eqn{p}-dimensional column vector consisting of
an estimate of the covariance
between the outcome variable and each covariate.
In the univariate case \eqn{R^2} is replaced by \eqn{\rho^2}
}

\section{Power approximation using non-centrality parameter}{

The prospective power estimations are based on (Kieser M. Methods and Applications of Sample Size Calculation and Recalculation in Clinical Trials. Springer; 2020).
The ANOVA power is calculated based on the non-centrality parameter given as

\deqn{nc =\sqrt{\frac{r}{(1+r)^2}\cdot n}\cdot\frac{\beta_1-\beta_0-\Delta_s}{\sigma},}

where we denote by \eqn{\sigma^2} the variance of the outcome, such that the power can be estimated as

\deqn{1-\beta = 1 - F_{t,n-2,nc}\left(F_{t, n-2, 0}^{-1}(1-\alpha)\right).}

The power of ANCOVA with univariate covariate adjustment and no interaction is calculated based on the non-centrality parameter given as

\deqn{nc =\sqrt{\frac{rn}{(1+r)^2}}\frac{\beta_1-\beta_0-\Delta_s}{\sigma\sqrt{1-\rho^2}},}

such that the power can be estimated as

\deqn{1-\beta = 1 - F_{t,n-3,nc}\left(F_{t, n-3, 0}^{-1}(1-\alpha)\right).}

The power of ANCOVA with either univariate covariate adjustment and interaction or multiple covariate adjustement with or without interaction is calculated based on the non-centrality parameter given as

\deqn{nc =\frac{\beta_1-\beta_0-\Delta_s}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_0} + X_d^\top\left((n-2)\Sigma_X\right)^{-1}X_d \right)\sigma^2\left(1-\widehat{R}^2\right)}}.}

where \eqn{X_d \coloneqq \left(\overline{X}_1^1-\overline{X}_0^1, \ldots, \overline{X}_1^p-\overline{X}_0^p\right)^\top}, \eqn{\widehat{R}^2\coloneqq \frac{\widehat{\sigma}_{XY}^\top \widehat{\Sigma}_X^{-1}\widehat{\sigma}_{XY}}{\widehat{\sigma}^2}},
we denote by \eqn{\widehat{\sigma^2}} an estimate of the variance of the outcome,
\eqn{\widehat{\Sigma_X}} and estimate of the covariance matrix of the
covariates, and \eqn{\widehat{\sigma_{XY}}} a \eqn{p}-dimensional column vector consisting of
an estimate of the covariance
between the outcome variable and each covariate.
Since we are in the case of randomized trials the expected difference between the covariate
values between the to groups is 0. Furthermore, the elements of \eqn{\Sigma_X^{-1}} will be small, unless the variances are close to 0, or the covariates exhibit strong linear dependencies, so that the correlations are close to 1.
These scenarios are excluded since they could lead to potentially serious problems regarding inference either way. These arguments are used by Zimmermann et. al
(Zimmermann G, Kieser M, Bathke AC. Sample Size Calculation and Blinded Recalculation for Analysis of Covariance Models with Multiple Random Covariates. Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics. 2020;30(1):143–159.) to approximate
the non-centrality parameter as in the univariate case where \eqn{\rho^2} is replaced by \eqn{R^2}.

Then the power for ANCOVA with \code{d} degrees of freedom can be estimated as

\deqn{1-\beta = 1 - F_{t,d,nc}\left(F_{t, d,0), 0}^{-1}(1-\alpha)\right).}
