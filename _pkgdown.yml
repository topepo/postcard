- title: Estimation of marginal effects in GLMs for two-armed randomised trials
  desc: >
    In cases where observations are randomly allocated into binary groups, any group effect estimand is
    most robustly estimated using plug-in estimation and estimating the variance using influence functions

- subtitle: Estimation using prognostic scores
  desc: >
    When historical data is available from one group, a (prognostic) model can be fit to the historical
    data, which is then used to predict outcomes for all observations and used as a covariate in the model
    to improve efficiency

- title: Power approximation
  desc: >
    Approximation formulas exist to estimate the sample size needed to obtain a power of a chosen
    level. Functionalities are implemented here to utilise these formulas to approximate the power
    from a given sample size and assumed effect size together with other parameters.

    Used in development for examples, vignettes and tests, but exported to enable users to perform
    exploratory analyses across different scenarios of simulated data with and without prognostic
    covariate adjustment
