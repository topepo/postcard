postcard provides tools for accurately estimating marginal effects using
plug-in estimation with GLMs, including increasing precision using
prognostic covariate adjustment. See [Powering RCTs for marginal effects
with GLMs using prognostic score
adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22284) by Højbjerre-Frandsen et.
al (2025).

### Estimating marginal effects

`rctglm()` is used to estimate marginal effects. See introductory
examples of its usage in `vignette("postcard")` and more details in
`vignette("model-fit")`.

*Marginal effects* are causal effects of the form $r(\Psi_1, \Psi_0)$,
where $\Psi_a=\mathbb{E}[Y(a)]$ are population mean outcomes under
exposure $a=0, 1$, respectively. These are sometimes referred to as
*counterfactual means*. The package uses *plug-in estimation for robust
estimation of any marginal effect estimand* as well as *influence
functions for robust estimation of the variance of the estimand*
(Rosenblum, M. and M. J. van der Laan, 2010: Simple, efficient
estimators of treatment effects in randomized trials using generalized
linear models to leverage baseline variables. The International Journal
of Biostatistics, 6, no. 1).

### Prognostic covariate adjustment

`rctglm_with_prognosticscore()` is used to estimate marginal effects
including the use of prognostic covariate adjustment. See introductory
examples of its usage in `vignette("postcard")` and more details in
`vignette("model-fit")`.

*Prognostic covariate adjustment* involves training a *prognostic model*
on historical data to predict the response in that data. Assuming that
the historical data is representative of the comparator group in a
*“new”* data set, we can use the prognostic model to predict the
*comparator counterfactual outcome* for all observations (including the
ones in the comparator group). This prediction, which is called the
**prognostic score**, is then used as an adjustment covariate in the
GLM.

## Power approximation

Implementations of sample size/power approximation formulas are
available, enabling retrospective power analyses to be performed using
the package.

Introductory examples are available in `vignette("postcard")` and more
details in `vignette("prospective-power")`.

### When estimating marginal effects using any model

A method of estimating power in any case of estimating marginal effects
is described in the reference at the top of this page, and the algorithm
is implemented in the function `power_marginaleffect`.

### Specifically for linear models

Functionalities available to estimate the power for linear models
include functions `variance_ancova`, `power_gs`, `samplesize_gs`,
`power_nc`.
